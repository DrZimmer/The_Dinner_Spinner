# The_Dinner_Spinner

## As a user I want to see a list of restaurants in a destination of my choosing so I can easily find a place to eat. I want to view restaurants within a city of my choosing and select a cuisine of my choice, or a random cuisine. When I click the search button I am presented with a list of 10 restaurants in both a list and a random spinner wheel. When I click Spin, it will pick a restaurant and random and save it to my dinner history. When I click on a restaurant from the presented list, it will save to my dinner history. You can choose to both pick a random restaurant using the spinner, or choosing from the list.
